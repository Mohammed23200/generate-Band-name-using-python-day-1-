# 🐍 Team Name Generator

A fun little Python script I built as part of my first Python lecture with Dr. Naglaa.  
The idea is super simple: the user enters a country and an animal, and the program combines them into a cool team name.

## 📸 Example
What's your favorite country? Brazil
What's your favorite animal? Panda
Your team name is: Brazil Panda!
